# Edinburgh App

## Project Brief

4 person group project at CodeClan Edinburgh. We were tasked with creating an educational full-stack web app using APIs and interactive functionality based on JavaScript.

## Description

This is a MongoDB back-end and JavaScript front-end full stack project. Focus was efficiency and usability.

Setting up, populating and pulling data from a MongoDB-based API proved central to the development of the app.

The Google Map has interactive functionality where places can be added to a persistant favourites list for future reference.
